# The Battle of Aliens and Humanity

## Choose Your Own Adventure

 The purpose of creating this repository is to show off all of our knowledge on linking files, using GitHub, using the command line (IDE), and collaporating with a partner on the same repo. We have been exposed to the obstacles that we may face while completing this projects such as merge conflicts and this repo can serve as practice in avoiding that obstacle. It is our job to communicate with each other to avoid merge conflicts and other problems that we may face.

 For our project, we have created an adventure featuring a hypothetical scenario called, "Aliens Versus Humans" which is self explanatory. Now that the talking is over, go ahead and try the ADVENTURE!
